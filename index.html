		<h1>"We can start with a history... in everything we do."</h1>
		<p>Hi everyone,
			
			I’m a 28 years old brazilian designer with a strong interest for product design, UX/UI design and Branding. I have a major degree in Product Design and a master in Service Design. During the Product Design course, although studying the basic concepts of design, I came across the comprehension that each person is connected to the collective, without diminishing their individuality and more, design made me believe that it’s a tool to stabilise a dialogue between culture and human needs before anything else.I also believe that we must increasingly understand the interactions between humans, objects, machines and services, then probably we will be capable to create both solutions for our everyday products such as digital interfaces and services to our clients. 
			At this present, I’m currently helping young start-ups and companies achieve success via effective branding strategies and service design tools, applying the design concepts to capture, generate and deliver relevant values that can be perceived by people. 
			In my spare time I keep pursuing my interest by doing graphic concepts, studying more about UX/UI Design and HTML /CSS Languages and building cool wood stuff.
